Simple Rule-Based Chatbot
This is a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It uses basic if-else statements to identify keywords in the user's input and provides appropriate responses. This project is intended to help you understand the basics of natural language processing and conversation flow.

Features
Keyword Matching: The chatbot can identify and respond to specific keywords or phrases like "hello," "how are you," "your name," and "goodbye."
Basic Conversation Flow: The chatbot simulates a simple conversation by recognizing user inputs and replying with predefined responses.
Exit Option: The chatbot session can be ended by typing "exit" or "quit."
How It Works
The chatbot listens for user inputs and checks for specific keywords or phrases using if-else statements. Based on the input, it returns an appropriate response. If the input doesn't match any predefined rules, the chatbot asks the user to rephrase.
