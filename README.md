  <h1>TASK 1 - Simple Rule-Based Chatbot</h1>
  <p>This simple chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It uses basic if-else statements to identify keywords in the user's input and provides appropriate responses. This project will help you understand the basics of natural language processing and conversation flow.</p>

  <h1>Features</h1>
  <h3>Keyword Matching:</h3>
  <p> The chatbot can identify and respond to specific keywords or phrases like "hello," "how are you," "your name," and "goodbye."</p>
  <h3>Basic Conversation Flow:</h3>
  <p>The chatbot simulates a simple conversation by recognizing user inputs and replying with predefined responses.</p>
  <h3>Exit Option:</h3>
  <p>The chatbot session can be ended by typing "exit" or "quit."</p>
  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>The chatbot listens for user inputs and checks for specific keywords or phrases using if-else statements. Based on the input, it returns an appropriate response. If the input doesn't match any predefined rules, the chatbot asks the user to rephrase.</p>


<h1>Task 2 - Image Captioning AI</h1>
<p>This project focuses on developing an AI model that generates descriptive captions for images by combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques. The model uses pre-trained image recognition models such as VGG or ResNet to extract features from images and then applies a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions.
</p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<p>Feature Extraction: Utilizes pre-trained image recognition models (VGG, ResNet) to extract meaningful features from images.
Caption Generation: Employs RNNs or transformer-based models to generate captions based on the extracted features.
End-to-End Pipeline: Supports the entire pipeline from feature extraction to caption generation and evaluation.</p>


<h1>Task 3 - TicTacToe</h1> 
<p>
This project implements an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI is designed to be unbeatable by using the Minimax algorithm ensuring that it always makes the optimal move. This project serves as an excellent introduction to game theory and basic search algorithms.</p>

<h3>Features : </h3>
<p>Unbeatable AI: Implements the Minimax algorithm to make the AI player unbeatable.
Human vs. AI: Play against the AI in a standard Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Interactive Interface: Simple console-based interface for playing the game.</p>
